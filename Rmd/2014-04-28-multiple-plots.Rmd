Multiple plots in ggplot2
========================================================

As I have mentioned previously is that I use ggplots a ton in my work.  It is my goto for plotting in R and I have really loved the ease of plotting with this package.  One thing that can see kind of tricky is plotting multiple panels in a single figure.   There are a couple of different ways to do this using **ggplot2** and the **gridExtra** packages.  

### ggplot2 and facet_wrap
Within **ggplot2** there is [`facet_wrap`](http://docs.ggplot2.org/0.9.3.1/facet_wrap.html) which will allow you to create multiple panels by a variable with a single line of code.  

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
 ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price, fill = ..density..)) +
  xlim(0, 2) + stat_binhex(na.rm = TRUE) + 
  facet_wrap(~ color) + 
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1) 
d + facet_wrap(~ color)
```

p <- qplot(price, data = diamonds, geom = "histogram", binwidth = 1000)
p + facet_wrap(~ color)
